**what currently exists?**
The agent has created the basic file structure for a WordPress theme located at . It includes core files like , , , , , and several page templates. A ZIP archive of this theme exists at .

In parallel, the agent built a live preview of the theme using a React application in the  directory. This React app includes the homepage layout, images, a slider, and district-specific pages requested by the user. Most of the recent feature additions (slider, district pages) were implemented only in the React preview and have not been fully translated to the PHP WordPress theme.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Redundant Development of React App and WordPress Theme**
    - The agent has been developing a React app in parallel to the WordPress theme. The user's request is for a **WordPress theme only**. This dual approach is inefficient and confusing.
    - **Debug checklist:** Confirm with the user that the React app is no longer needed. Cease all work on the  directory and focus exclusively on completing the WordPress theme in .
    - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** To focus efforts on the actual deliverable and avoid wasted work.
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** N/A
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **WordPress Theme Development:** Creating a custom theme using PHP, including template files (, ), page templates, and a  file for custom logic.
- **React:** Used to create a visual preview of the theme. This should be considered a temporary guide, not a deliverable.
- **Local SEO:** Focus on creating specific URL structures for locations to rank in local search results.
- **Google Policy Compliance:** Crafting content carefully to avoid making misleading claims about being an authorized service.

**key DB schema**
- N/A

**changes in tech stack**
- The project pivoted from a full-stack React/FastAPI application to a traditional PHP-based WordPress theme, as per the user's request. The original backend and database are not in use.

**All files of reference**
- : The directory containing all files for the final WordPress theme. This is the primary work area.
- : The deliverable archive containing the theme.
- : The React component containing the live preview. Should be used for visual reference only.
- : The file where the Made with Emergent text is located.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The development workflow must be refactored to eliminate the redundant work on the React application. All development efforts should be consolidated into the  directory to build the final PHP theme.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Focus on WordPress, Not React:** The previous agent built a React app as a preview, which is not the user's requested deliverable. You must shift all focus to completing the **PHP WordPress theme** located in . Use the React app only as a visual guide for features already designed.
- **User Language is Turkish:** You must communicate with the user exclusively in Turkish.
- **Incomplete Features:** The slider and district sub-pages exist in the React preview but need to be properly implemented within the WordPress theme using PHP and native WordPress functions (, etc.).
- **Primary Goal:** The final output must be a ready-to-install WordPress theme ( file) that is fast, SEO-friendly, and fully compliant with Google's advertising policies.
